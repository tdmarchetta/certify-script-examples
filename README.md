# certify-script-examples

Example and user-contributed scripts (PowerShell etc) for certificate deployment. Note that some of these tasks may require additional permissions or configuration to work correctly. Some script may already be replaced by built-in Deployment Tasks with the app itself.

Read more about scripting basics here: https://docs.certifytheweb.com/docs/script-hooks

In general these scripts are uses with the *Run a Powershell Script* Deployment Task.

The scripts used by some of the official Certify The Web deployment tasks are also available in the plugins source code repository: https://github.com/webprofusion/certify-plugins/tree/development/src/DeploymentTasks/Core/Providers/Assets
